###About this app
```
This application is a game maze which finds a shortest path between start point and end point
by avoiding obstacle squares. The start and end point in the maze are placed by the user by
simply touching one of the squares. User can reset start and end location of square points.
After setting start and end square points, user can then place obstacle red squares.
The purpose of this maze is to reach the end point by avoiding all red square obstacles.
In case the dead end is reached, the best traced path so far gets backtracked until another
path is found or no path is found.
